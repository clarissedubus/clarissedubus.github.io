            "description": "This project developed as a collaboration with Elizabeth Bragg, Food Consultant, and Nicholas Tannett, Sous-Chef at Chiltern Firehouse. We teamed up to organise an organic pop-up restaurant in London, serving a five course menu accompanied by three bespoke cocktails. All food was served in wooden plates designed for the occasion with a natural finish aimed at highlighting the importance of sustainable ingredients and homemade food. The idea was to allow the collection to resonate with the interior, landscape and graphic design, which were all developed specifically for the event. Interior Architecture. Graphic Design: Homemade Stamps for menu and invitation. Plates: Oak, rosewood, brass.",

            "description": "This is the project text. The whole point about this project is that Clarisse's dream was to fall in love with a little weasel from Peru. She had been looking all over the place for little weasels, but she never knew that what they love most is supper clubs. One day she began looking for a supperclub and she found one under the tree next to the pub in the oceanfront. She ran really quickly to see if she could grab it before it disappeared, as supperclubs disappear really quickly, and she somehow managed to get there before everything and everyone else. So she quickly grabbed the supperclub and used it to find the weasel.",

            "description": "The botte-cul is the name given to the monopode stool used by farmers to milk cows in the valleys of the Alps. It was often attached around the waist using a strap or belt that allowed for ease of movement in the stable. The specificity of purpose of the botte-cul contrasts with the universality of many everyday objects. We often sit and recline without thinking or taking notice of how our bodies are interacting with the environment. The design of the Botte-Cul Stool builds on the historic use of the botte-cul to provide context to an object that enables some of the most repetitive and automatic of our actions. White shoes, oak, metal.",

            "description": "A bench is an object that fosters connections. It creates social links and relations between bodies and space. Not only is it a point of reference or orientation within its context, but also serves to identify the purpose of a given location. Itâ€™s in this spirit that this bench has been developed. It is a reflection of its surroundings, blending with the architecture that upholds it by imitating its curves, extending them, and thus allowing us to better connect with its environment. L150 x W45 x H250cm. Wood, metal. Exhibited at the Galerie VIA in Paris and Designhuis in Eindhoven.",
